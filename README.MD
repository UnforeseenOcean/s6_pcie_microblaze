## What

This repository contains a set of tools and proof of concepts related to PCI-E bus and [DMA attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack). It includes HDL design which implements software controllable PCI-E gen 1.1 endpoint device for [Xilinx SP605 Evaluation Kit](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-s6-sp605-g.html) with Spartan-6 FPGA. In comparison with popular [USB3380EVB](http://www.hwtools.net/Adapter/USB3380EVB.html) this design allows to operate with raw Transaction Level Packets (TLP) of PCI-E bus and perform full 64-bit memory read/write operations. It's early version of my first much or less complicated FPGA project, so the speed is quite slow (around 1-2 Mb/s), but in upcoming releases it will be significantly increased by connecting PCI-E endpoint to MicroBlaze soft processor with AXI DMA engine. However, even such low speed is more than enough for reliable implementation of various practical attacks over PCI-E bus: to demonstrate applied use cases of the design, there's a tool for pre-boot DMA attacks on UEFI based machines which allow executing arbitrary UEFI DXE drivers during platform init. Another example shows how to use pre-boot DMA attacks to inject Hyper-V VM exit handler backdoor into the [virtualization-based security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) enabled Windows 10 Enterprise running on UEFI Secure Boot enabled platform. Provided Hyper-V backdoor PoC might be useful for reverse engineering and exploit development purposes, it provides an interface for inspecting of hypervisor state (VMCS, physical/virtual memory, registers, etc.) from guest partition and perform the guest to host VM escape attacks.

## SP605 board configuration

<img src="images/board.jpg" width="800" height="415">

Xilinx UG526 document also known as [SP605 Hardware User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/ug526.pdf) is your best friend if you want to know more details about usage and configuration of this nice board.

1) To load bitstream from onboard SPI flash chip you need to configure SP605 by turning `SW1` switches into the 1-ON, 2-OFF position.

2) Now you have to write FPGA bitstream into the SPI flash. Use `s6_pcie_microblaze.mcs` file if you want to do it over JTAG with the help of Xilinx iMPACT utility (see [this tutorial](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/sp605_PCIe_Gen1_x1_pdf_xtp065_13.4.pdf)), or `s6_pcie_microblaze.bin` if you're going to use [external SPI programmer](https://www.flashrom.org/Supported_programmers) connected to `J17` header of SP605 (which is the most faster and convenient way). 

In case of [flashrom](https://www.flashrom.org/) compatible external SPI programmer you can use `flash_to_spi.py` program as a flashrom wrapper:

```
# ./flash_to_spi.py s6_pcie_microblaze.bin
Using region: "main".
Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q64.V" (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Reading old flash chip contents... done.
Erasing and writing flash chip...
Warning: Chip content is identical to the requested image.
Erase/write done.  
```

3) Bitstream which was written into the SPI flash in previous step includes a bootloader for MicroBlaze core (see `sdk/srec_bootloader_0/src/srec_bootloader.c` for more details). This bootloader allows to configure board options and write main program into the linear flash.

To boot MicroBlaze into the update mode you have to disconnect SPI programmer and power up the board holding SW4 pushbutton switch, release `SW4` when `DS6` LED indicating active update mode turns on. 

4) To write the main program (see `sdk/main_0/src/main.c` for more details) into the linear flash connect your computer to UART bridge USB port of SP605 and run bootloaderctl.py program with `--flash` option:

```
# easy_install pyserial
# ./python/bootloaderctl.py /dev/ttyUSB0 --flash sdk/main_0/Debug/main_0.srec
[+] Opening device "/dev/ttyUSB0"...
[+] Flasing 339852 bytes from "sdk/main_0/Debug/main_0.srec"...
Erasing flash...
Writing 0x100 bytes at 0x00100000
Writing 0x100 bytes at 0x00100100

...

Writing 0x100 bytes at 0x00152e00
Writing 0x8c bytes at 0x00152f00
[+] DONE
```

5) To configure board network settings run bootloaderctl.py program with `--config` option:

```
# ./python/bootloaderctl.py /dev/ttyUSB0 --config 192.168.2.247:255.255.255.0:192.168.2.1:28472
[+] Opening device "/dev/ttyUSB0"...
[+] Updating board settings...

 Gateway: 192.168.2.1
    Port: 28472

Erasing flash...
Writing 0x12 bytes at 0x00000000
[+] DONE
```

6) Now you can exit from the update mode and boot main MicroBlaze program from linear flash:

```
# ./python/bootloaderctl.py /dev/ttyUSB0 --boot
[+] Opening device "/dev/ttyUSB0"...
[+] Exitting from update mode...

SREC Bootloader

[+] Netmask: 255.255.255.0
[+] Gateway: 192.168.2.1

start_application(): TCP server is started at port 28472
```

Main program prints it's error messages into the onboard UART, you can use `--console` option of `bootloaderctl.py` to monitor those messages in real time. 

7) Connect SP605 to the PCI-E slot of the target computer and turn the computer on. When PCI-E link was sucessfully established SP605 will fire `DS3` and `DS4` LEDs.

8) Run `lspci` command on target computer to ensure that it is seeing your board as PCI-E device:

```
# lspci | grep Xilinx
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Xilinx Corporation Default PCIe endpoint ID
```

JTAG related notes: SP605 has onboard USB to JTAG interface compatible with iMPACT and others Xilinx tools. However, it's not very good so if you're planning to use onboard JTAG to program SPI flash like it was described in Xilinx tutorial you have to do the following things:

* Remove any hardware connected to the FMC slot of SP605 while working with JTAG. 

* In Xilinx iMPACT settings configure JTAG interface to use 750 KHz speed (on more higher speed it works unstable).


## Software configuration

Python tools to interact with the board and tiny implementation of PCI-E link layer are located in `python` folder. Because main MicroBlaze program uses TCP to transfer TLP packets no any drivers or 3rd party dependencies needed, you can use provided Python code on any operating system. 

To set up target board IP address and port edit `PCIE_TO_TCP_ADDR` variable in `python/pcie_lib_config.py` file.

Provided Python software uses some environment variables to override values of certain options:

* `DEBUG_TLP` &minus; If set to `1` print TX and RX TLP packets dump into the standard output.

* `TARGET_ADDR` &minus; `<address>:<port>` string to override IP address of the board specified in `python/pcie_lib_config.py` file.


## Using Python API

Python library `pcie_lib.py` provides low level API to send and receive PCE-E TLP (Transaction Level Packet) requests, abstractions for different TLP types and high level physical memory access API.

The following program demonstrates how to work with raw TLPs using pcie_lib:

```python
from pcie_lib import *

#
# Open PCI-E device, optional addr parameter overrides value specified in pcie_lib_config.py
# file or TARGET_ADDR environment variable
#
dev = TransactionLayer(addr = ( '192.168.2.247', 28472 ))

# get bus:device.function address of our PCI-E endpoint
bus_id = dev.get_bus_id()

#
# MRd TLP request which reads 1 dword of memory at address 0x1000
#
tlp_tx = [ 0x20000001,                   # TLP type and data size
           0x000000ff | (bus_id << 16),  # requester ID
           0x00000000,                   # high dword of physical memory address
           0x00001000 ]                  # low dword of physical memory address
         
# send TLP
dev.write(tlp_tx)

# receive root complex reply
tlp_rx = dev.read(raw = True)

# prints 4a000001 00000004 01000000 00000000
print('%.8x %.8x %.8x %.8x' % tuple(tlp_rx))

# check for CplD TLP format and type
assert (tlp_rx[0] >> 24) & 0xff == 0x4a

# print readed dword
print('%.8x' % tlp_rx[3])

dev.close()
```

Working with TLPs using more convenient high level abstractions:

```python
# MRd TLP request which reads 1 dword of memory at address 0x1000
tlp_tx = dev.PacketMRd64(dev.bus_id, 0x1000, 4)

# send TLP
dev.write(tlp_tx)

# receive root complex reply
tlp_rx = dev.read()

# check for CplD TLP
assert isinstance(tlp_rx, dev.PacketCplD)

# print readed dword
print('%.8x' % tlp_rx.data[0])
```

Accessing physical memory:

```python
# write bytes to memory
dev.mem_write(0x1000, '\xAA' * 0x10)

# write single qword/dword/word/byte to memory
dev.mem_write_8(0x1000, 0)
dev.mem_write_4(0x1000, 0)
dev.mem_write_2(0x1000, 0)
dev.mem_write_1(0x1000, 0)

# read bytes from memory
print(repr(dev.mem_read(0x1000, 0x10)))

# read single qword/dword/word/byte from memory
print('%.16x' % dev.mem_read_8(0x1000))
print('%.8x' % dev.mem_read_4(0x1000))
print('%.4x' % dev.mem_read_2(0x1000))
print('%.2x' % dev.mem_read_1(0x1000))
```


## Practical attacks

Python program `uefi_backdoor_simple.py` injects dummy UEFI DXE driver located in `payloads/DmaBackdoorSimple` into the target using preboot DMA attack. It's usage:

1) Boot the MicroBlaze and connect SP605 to PCI-E port of target computer and Ethernet network. 

2) Run the following command: 

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_simple.py payloads/DmaBackdoorSimple/DmaBackdoorSimple_X64.efi
```

3) Power on the target computer, in case of successful attack in couple of seconds you will see debug messages screen of injected UEFI driver.

Example of debug messages on attack target screen:

## Troubleshooting

PCI Express is very complicated high speed bus so there's a lot of things that can go wrong. If DMA attack is not working on your setup you might check the following things to determine the exact problem:

* `DS3` LED is on when physical PCI-E link is up and `DS4` is on when root complex had assigned bus:device.function address to our PCI-E endpoint. If `DS3` is off it likely means physical connectivity issue &minus; check your risers, cables, etc. If `DS3` is on but `DS4` is off it means that you had to reboot your attack target or force PCI-E devices rescan on it's side. 

* `DS5` LED is on during PCI-E bus reset, when it always on it means physical connectivity issue.

* If root complex sends Cpl TLP instead of CplD TLP in reply to memory read request it means that memory access was rejected because of invalid address or IOMMU enforced access cheks. Also typical x86 machine might not reply at all on memory read requests to some certain physical address space regions. 

* If software receiving inconsistent or invalid TLPs from root complex in reply to memory read requests you might try to set a smaller value of `MEM_RD_TLP_LEN` constant in `pcie_lib.py` to split reply data into more smaller chunks. Also it's useful to run the program with `DEBUG_TLP=1` environment variable and check raw TX/RX TLP dump.


## Building project from the source code

1) Install Xilinx ISE 13.4 which comes with your SP605 board and open `s6_pcie_microblaze.xise` project file.

2) Regenerate `s6_pcie_v2_4` and `fifo_generator_v8_4` cores which presents in project hierarchy. 

3) Click on `microblaze_i` instance in project hierarchy and run "Export Hardware Design to SDK With Bitstream".

4) When build will be completed ISE opens Xilinx Software Development Kit IDE, use `sdk` folder as it's workspace. 

5) Create new standalone board support package in your Xilinx SDK project tree, choose lwIP and xilflash libraries in BSP configuration. 

6) Import `sdk/srec_bootloader_0` and `sdk/main_0` projects into the project tree and run the build.

7) Run `make_out.sh` (or `make_out.bat`) shell script from Xilinx ISE command prompt to generate needed output files. 


## TODO

* Implement SP605 MicroBlaze based design support for [pcileech](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech).

* Use Xilinx AXI DMA core for more fast data transfer between DDR3 memory of MicroBlaze and PCI-E hard IP block.

* Release [DMA to System Management Mode exploit](https://twitter.com/d_olex/status/877718172366798848) when Intel will fix appropriate vulnerability.
